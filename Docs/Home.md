> [!IMPORTANT]
> Previously there were branches for every GameMaker version respectively, but now the branches are merged into the `main` branch since the extension is compatible with all the versions from v2.3.7 to v2024. **It is recommended to use GML-Extended version 1.5.0+ for the best compatibility and performance with all GameMaker Versions.**
